# LoanAmortizationGenerator
Loan Amortization Generator built with C# and SSMS by John Quester C. Loyola

The Winform named "Loan_Schedule_Generator" is my main Project
The Console Project named "Formula Console" was the Formula I would supposedly have used for the App, although I didn't accomplish it within the timeframe.

Thank you for giving me the opportunity for this Exam. I had a blast learning new things again since I am rusty in coding, It's quite sad that I did not complete the exam given the conflict of time due to my workload but I still gave it my all.

My methodology was to create a Fact Table and a Dim Table so that it is maintanable. 
I indeed was able to create a class in which it was able to find the Discount Factor and the Monthly Amortization. It just so happens I got stuck in the insertion of the DateTime to my tables. I'm not quite good with DateTimes. This is really a great moment in my career since I got my fire back in coding and this is exactly what I needed ever since I started out my career. Thank you for this wonderful exam with all my heart, I learned so much about OOP, SSMS, and calculations for loan amortization.

This really was an eye-opener for me. I hope you give me a chance even as an Entry or Associate Programmer because I really want to learn more about the industry.
